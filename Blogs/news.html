		<p>In todays idiot's blog chronicling the learning steps of how to create a DCS server and associated website, I'm continuing working through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" target="_blank" title="Mozilla Web Docs">Mozilla MDN Docs Guides and Tutorials</a>, and currently starting the "HTML â€” Structuring the Web, Introduction to HTML, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting" target="_blank" title="Go to Advanced Text Formatting">Advanced text formatting</a>" chapter. This Rising Thunder Alfa Test website is becoming a little more "developed?", with a small number of useless and dysfunctional features, but features, none the less.</p>
		<p>Thanks to a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZyEv_VrwGLq-UcgANDb0IQ" target="_blank" title="Go to DCS Flighttraining's Youtube Channel">DCS Flighttraining</a> on YouTube, "<a href="https://youtu.be/c19Gi0SjEE0" target="_blank" title="Open the YouTube video">Basics of exporting data out of DCS World via Export.lua</a>", I've learned how to export the current mission time from DCS to a txt file. When the "<code>LoGetModelTime()</code>" function is inserted into the <var>Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/Export.lua</var> file, it will generate a "living" data.txt file, the last line being the current DCS mission time. Of course, I still do not know how to export this data from the text file into a HTML file.</p>

	    <p>For my next step of this idiots guide quest, I've completed the Mozilla "Getting started with the Web" course, an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	       In the process of working through this introductory course, I created my own simple exercise webpage as suggested by the author, instead of just cutting and pasting the giving examples of code, and I did some experimental customization, geared towards a DCS Server theme, of course. My next step in this quest is to work through the Mozilla "Learning HTML: Guides and tutorials" course.</p>

	    <p>First, I'm very new, and an "idiot" at setting up servers and webpages.
          However, I do have a dedicated DCS server successfully running on my local machine, using the default DCS server ports.
		  Additionaly I have successfully installed <a href="https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=155563" target="_blank" title="Go to Slmod Thread">Slmod</a>, and it seams to work, using basic -help commands, and etc.</p>

        <p>For a beginners practice and learning exercise, and for the motivation of success, or the agony of defeat, I would like learn how to simply export just the following data;</p>

		<dl>
		  <dt>Servers Current:</dt>
		    <dd>mission start time,</dd>
		    <dd>actual and "running"- "DCS server mission map time",</dd>
		    <dd>"mission end time" as set by the "<samp>TIME MORE</samp>" conditions, for the "<samp>END MISSION</samp>" or "<samp>LOAD MISSION</samp>" action triggers,</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>Into a local webpage/html file, in a standard 24 hour digital output/readout, and having the current missions time displayed as a running digita output and horizontal bar-graph.</p>

		<p>For example;<br>
		   Mission Start --- Current Map Time --- End Time<br>
           0600 ------------ 0900 --------------- 1400<br>
		   <span class="bluetext">[_______________|</span>_________________]</p>

		<p>Can this be done using just a local html file, and opened with a browser (Firefox), or must I install something like a Python's "SimpleHTTPServer" module? <span class="greytext">[EDIT] Yes, Python SimpleHTTPSever or simular will be needed.</span>
		   Will I need any other "app"? How do I export the data, and "link" it to the webpage (or app, if needed).<span class="greytext"> [EDIT] To export time data <em>from the DCS server</em> see our Code Repository. I still do not know how it import the time data into a html file.</span></p>

		<p>If anyone would like to take the time to write a idiot guide, or post in how to accomplish this basic feat, it would be greatly appreciated.<br>
		   I'm thinking this exercise will be a great help in explaining and showing the basics of setting up a DCS Server, with an associated webpage. Also I'm assuming the basic concepts of this exercise will apply to most other planned functions going forward.</p>
