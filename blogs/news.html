		  <p>As with most of the World, I've been distracted by the Coved-19 virus, which has interfered with my work on the Rising Thunder Server and my studies to see this project come to a reality. Hope all the reader of this blog stay safe and well. May Gods mercies be on all of us.<br>
		     With this said, should any readers of this blog like to help me out with this project, please message me via a <a href="https://forums.eagle.ru/member.php?u=113063" target="_blank">DCS private message</a>.</p>
		  <p>Thanks to <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/u/chrisdavidmills" target="_blank">chrisdavidmills</a> over at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN web docs</a> for helping me out with this project. <a href="../code/java-projects/import-time-data.html" target="_blank">Linked here</a> is an example of javascript that will inport DCS time data to a html webpage as expected.</p>
          <p>The next goal is, I’d like to be able to change how the writeData, lastStamp output values are displayed, for example, I’ve set the lua script to write to the “time-log.txt” file every 6 seconds. As the accumulated time changes to minutes, I'd like for the values to change as displayed, from seconds, to minutes:seconds, to hours:minutes:seconds format as time accumulates.</p>

		<p>After a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, I'm still working through the MDN web docs chapter <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data" target="_blank">Sending form data</a>. In doing so I found the php server app <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">Wampsever</a> and this video "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Fhu_6RuMw&t=" target="_blank">Installing, Troubleshooting and Configuring WAMP server for Windows 10</a>" which was very helpful for quickly setting up a local php server for a beginner.</p>
		<p>In the subsection "Example: Raw PHP" of the above chapter "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data" target="_blank">Sending form data</a>", in the ending subsection note box, two php server apps, are listed, <a href="https://www.ampps.com/" target="_blank">AMPPS</a> and <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">MAMP</a>. However, I found AMPPS to be too much for my beginning level, and the free version of MAMP, I could not get to work unless installing the time limited PRO version. Once the time limited pro version is expired, then the free version will not work again.</p>
		<p>Update to the above: to get the "free" MAMP working with it's contained Apache Server, go to the MAMPS > Preferences > PHP > and set "Standard Version:" to "7.2.14". That simple, but if you don't know, you don't know.</p>

		<p>In working through the MDN web docs tutorials, I have discovered that site, <a href="http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/" target="_blank">Miro Video Converter</a>. This could be helpfull later. I Completed and passed the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Mozilla_splash_page" target="_blank">Mozilla Splash page assessment</a> at 100%!<br>
		   Completed the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms" target="_blank">MDN Web docs HTML Tables Chapter</a> with a score of 82%, barely passing, however, I recognized the bug I introduced in the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Structuring_planet_data" target="_blank">Planet Data assessment</a>, so I'm moving on.
		   Fixed the revision footer error of the only page being updated (the main index page), by creating a separate js file for the site revision footers.</p>
		<p>This month I'm currently working through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data" target="_blank">MDN web docs "Sending form data" chapter</a>.

		<p>I'm still working through the mozilla <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding" target="_blank">MDN web docs Multimedia and embedding tutorials</a>, or to be more accurate, reworking through. In doing these tutorials, I’m setting a high critical standard for my objective learning experience, and if I fail an assessment, I rework that section, in order for me to make sure I’ve got a good understanding of the lesson subject matter. In working through this the second time I've also created a new media page.</p>
		<p>The first time through the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Mozilla_splash_page" target="_blank">Mozilla slash page assessment</a>, I forgot to write in the “400px” as the image “version that should be used otherwise” sizes attribute for the responsive images task, giving myself a score of 57%.  The second time through the assessment, I realized I didn’t understand that this same attribute variable should have the value of the larger image, consequently giving myself a score of 60%.  Also, in the first assessment attempt I didn’t optimize the images, mostly out of laziness, not knowing this was a “scoring task” in the Mozilla splash page assessment. So as of this date, I will be doing the  MDN web docs Multimedia and embedding tutorials again!</p>
		<p>In working through the MDM web docs tutorials, learned of this site <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">tinypng</a> for image optimization which could come in handy.</p>
		<p>And lastly, I filed a <a href="https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues/2225" target="_blank">Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutions - Article Error or Clarification</a>, if anyone actually ever reads this, and can respond would it be appreciated! </p>

		<p>In todays idiot's blog chronicling the learning steps of how to create a DCS server and associated website, I'm continuing working through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" target="_blank" title="Mozilla Web Docs">Mozilla MDN Docs Guides and Tutorials</a>, and currently starting the "HTML — Structuring the Web, Introduction to HTML, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting" target="_blank" title="Go to Advanced Text Formatting">Advanced text formatting</a>" chapter.

		<p>Thanks to a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZyEv_VrwGLq-UcgANDb0IQ" target="_blank" title="Go to DCS Flighttraining's Youtube Channel">DCS Flighttraining</a> on YouTube, "<a href="https://youtu.be/c19Gi0SjEE0" target="_blank" title="Open the YouTube video">Basics of exporting data out of DCS World via Export.lua</a>", I've learned how to export the current mission time from DCS to a txt file. When the "<code>LoGetModelTime()</code>" function is inserted into the <var>Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/Export.lua</var> file, it will generate a "living" data.txt file, the last line being the current DCS mission time. Of course, I still do not know how to export this data from the text file into a HTML file.</p>

	    <p>For my next step of this idiots guide quest, I've completed the Mozilla "Getting started with the Web" course, an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	       In the process of working through this introductory course, I created my own simple exercise webpage as suggested by the author, instead of just cutting and pasting the giving examples of code, and I did some experimental customization, geared towards a DCS Server theme, of course. My next step in this quest is to work through the Mozilla "Learning HTML: Guides and tutorials" course.</p>

	    <h5>[23JUL2019]</h5>
	    <p>First, I'm very new, and an "idiot" at setting up servers and webpages.
          However, I do have a dedicated DCS server successfully running on my local machine, using the default DCS server ports.
		  Additionaly I have successfully installed <a href="https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=155563" target="_blank" title="Go to Slmod Thread">Slmod</a>, and it seams to work, using basic -help commands, and etc.</p>

        <p>For a beginners practice and learning exercise, and for the motivation of success, or the agony of defeat, I would like learn how to simply export just the following data;</p>

		<dl>
		  <dt>Servers Current:</dt>
		    <dd>mission start time,</dd>
		    <dd>actual and "running"- "DCS server mission map time",</dd>
		    <dd>"mission end time" as set by the "<samp>TIME MORE</samp>" conditions, for the "<samp>END MISSION</samp>" or "<samp>LOAD MISSION</samp>" action triggers,</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>Into a local webpage/html file, in a standard 24 hour digital output/readout, and having the current missions time displayed as a running digita output and horizontal bar-graph.</p>

		<p>For example;<br>
		   Mission Start --- Current Map Time --- End Time<br>
           0600 ------------ 0900 --------------- 1400<br>
		   <span class="bluetext">[_______________|</span>_________________]</p>

		<p>Can this be done using just a local html file, and opened with a browser (Firefox), or must I install something like a Python's "SimpleHTTPServer" module? <span class="greytext">[EDIT] Yes, Python SimpleHTTPSever or simular will be needed.</span>
		   Will I need any other "app"? How do I export the data, and "link" it to the webpage (or app, if needed).<span class="greytext"> [EDIT] To export time data <em>from the DCS server</em> see our Code Repository. I still do not know how it import the time data into a html file.</span></p>

		<p>If anyone would like to take the time to write a idiot guide, or post in how to accomplish this basic feat, it would be greatly appreciated.<br>
		   I'm thinking this exercise will be a great help in explaining and showing the basics of setting up a DCS Server, with an associated webpage. Also I'm assuming the basic concepts of this exercise will apply to most other planned functions going forward.</p>
