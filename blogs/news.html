		<p>I've finally completed the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs: The box model</a> article and skills test. This learning article was fairly easy. Here is a link to my <a href="../code/css-examples/the-box-model.html" target="_blank">class project page</a> of The Box Model. Also, all of my MDN tutorial class projects pages can be found on the <a href="../code/code.html" target="_blank">Code Repository</a> page of this website. </p>
		<p>In reference of all things CSS and more, here are a coupe of really helpful &amp; interesting websites I've recently found working through these tutorials, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="blank">*CSS-TRICKS</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.30secondsofcode.org/" target="_blank">30 seconds of code</a>.</p>
		<p>Lastly, a couple of refresher/reviews notes, which I'm hand typing in here for my benefit. Such as, &quot;Relative length units are relative to something else, perhaps the size of the parent element's font, or the size of the viewport&quot;.
		   Unit <code>em</code> is the &quot;Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like <code>font-size</code>, and font size of the element itself, in the case of other properties like <code>width</code>&quot;. Reference CSS values and units: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths" target="_blank">Lengths</a> and font-size <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size#ems" target="_blank">Ems</a>.</p>
		<p>CSS defines a large set of named colors, so that common colors can be written and read more easily. These named colors can be found <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#named-colors" target="_blank">here at W3C</a>.</p>

		<p>I'm back at my MDN web docs studies after having to take a break for logistical reasons (a new house). I've just completed the MDN Web Docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Selectors_Tasks" target="_blank">Test your skills:Selectors</a> assessment. After taking such a long break from these studies, I will need to do the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors" target="_blank">CSS selectors</a> chapters over again.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">In other news, I created a Youtube playlist, <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlcTYcgtF3lqe_tTdUG0GTestwA_-TioA" target="_blank">DCS World Begins: Legacy of a Legend Cinematic Playlist</a>, showcasing 10 years of DCS World cinematic's with hours of official and select 3rd party cinematic videos.

		<p>This month of October, I've wrote a script for exporting time data to a TCP socket. You can get the script <a href="../code/export-files/Export-Time-to-Socket.lua" target="_blank">here</a> or on the <a href="https://forums.eagle.ru/forum/english/dcs-world-topics/multiplayer/multiplayer-server-administration/7115188-exporting-time-data-to-a-tcp-socket" target="_blank">DCS forums</a>. This scripts outputs the current accumulated time the server has been running in one second intervals, as a whole number value. You can view this data with <a href="https://github.com/Dirt-e/DCS-Export-Server-Simple/tree/master/TCP-Server%20Console/bin/Release" target="_blank">JaBoG32_Dirty's TCP-Server Console.</a></p>
		<p>Also, I created a very functional CH Products HOTAS map and related DCS World Control profile files for the Su-25T. This zip file also contains installation instruction, and .pdf &amp; .png map assignment layout images. You can install the .png layout images to your kneeboard using <a href="http://www.dcskneeboardbuilder.com/" target="_blank">DCS Kneeboard Builder</a>. You can download the zip file <a href="../code/ch-maps/su-25t_ch_hotas.zip">here</a> from the <a href="../code/code.html" target="_blank">Code Repository</a>.</p>
		<p>And as a bonus, I contracted the COVID-19 virus, which made me fairly ill for a couple of weeks, delaying my MDN web docs studies.</p>
		<p>Next step, if someone would like to help me, is I want to import the data onto a html webpage file, use AJAX, and then format it into a 24hour time format. For example, if the mission starts at 0600, add the accumulated mission (120 seconds) time and display it on the html page as 06:02. Could anyone help me with such a JavaScript code?</p>

		<p>I've accomplish the first goal of this project! Which is importing the mission time data into an html page, using the current time data exported from DCS World into a text file. For me, this is a important milestone, which I'm really happy about!
		   I'd like to give a shout out and thanks to @chrisdavidmills at the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250" target="_blank">mozilla Learn discourse</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZyEv_VrwGLq-UcgANDb0IQ/" target="_blank">DCS Flighttraining YouTube channel</a> for their invaluable help!
		   Here is the Rising Thunder Alpha Test "<a href="../statistics/import-time-data.html" target="_blank">Curren Mission Time Data</a>" html page link. Keep in mind when viewing this html page on the github server, the <code>dcs-time.txt</code> file is static and not being actively wrote onto, as if it would be on a active server with DCS World running. The github Rising Thunder Alpha Test website is just for demonstration purposes only. And the same for the time bar on the github <a href="../index.html" target="_blank">Rising Thunder Alpha Test home page</a>.
		   On a local computer hosting a MAMP web server for the Rising Thunder Alpha Test website, I successfully tested a DCS server/client, with the time bar on the Rising Thunder Alpha Test home page, and it functioned as inteneded, veiwed from a browser outside of my local network. By the way, <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/windows/" target="_blank">MAMP</a> is a really easy to use local web hosting app for testing your website projects.</p>
		 <p>I have also accomplished a successful test for a local MAMP web server, DCS server and client, <a href="http://dcssimpleradio.com/" target="http://dcssimpleradio.com/">SimpleRadio Standalone</a> server and client, with all servers and clients running on the same computer.</p>

          <p>The next goal is, I’d like to be able to change how the writeData, lastStamp output values are displayed, for example, I’ve set the lua script to write to the “time-log.txt” file every 6 seconds. As the accumulated time changes to minutes, I'd like for the values to change as displayed, from seconds, to minutes:seconds, to hours:minutes:seconds format as time accumulates.</p>

In doing so I found the php server app <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">Wampsever</a> and this video "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Fhu_6RuMw&t=" target="_blank">Installing, Troubleshooting and Configuring WAMP server for Windows 10</a>" which was very helpful for quickly setting up a local php server for a beginner.</p>
		<p>In the subsection "Example: Raw PHP" of the above chapter "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data" target="_blank">Sending form data</a>", in the ending subsection note box, two php server apps, are listed, <a href="https://www.ampps.com/" target="_blank">AMPPS</a> and <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">MAMP</a>. However, I found AMPPS to be too much for my beginning level, and the free version of MAMP, I could not get to work unless installing the time limited PRO version. Once the time limited pro version is expired, then the free version will not work again.</p>
		<p>Update to the above: to get the "free" MAMP working with it's contained Apache Server, go to the MAMPS > Preferences > PHP > and set "Standard Version:" to "7.2.14". That simple, but if you don't know, you don't know.</p>

In doing these tutorials, I’m setting a high critical standard for my objective learning experience, and if I fail an assessment, I rework that section, in order for me to make sure I’ve got a good understanding of the lesson subject matter. In working through this the second time I've also created a new media page.</p>
		<p>The first time through the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Mozilla_splash_page" target="_blank">Mozilla slash page assessment</a>, I forgot to write in the “400px” as the image “version that should be used otherwise” sizes attribute for the responsive images task, giving myself a score of 57%.  The second time through the assessment, I realized I didn’t understand that this same attribute variable should have the value of the larger image, consequently giving myself a score of 60%.  Also, in the first assessment attempt I didn’t optimize the images, mostly out of laziness, not knowing this was a “scoring task” in the Mozilla splash page assessment. So as of this date, I will be doing the  MDN web docs Multimedia and embedding tutorials again!</p>
		<p>In working through the MDM web docs tutorials, learned of this site <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">tinypng</a> for image optimization which could come in handy.</p>

		   Additionaly, in the process of working through this course I discovered this cool website, <a href="https://game-icons.net/tags.html" target="_blank" title="Game-icons.net">Game-icons.net</a> which could be helpfull in the future.</p>
		<p>To the right in this blog are a couple of videos I've embedded as a practice exercise for the Mozilla Web Docs "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content" target="_blank">Video an audio content</a>" chapter. The top video is set to autoplay, loop, and has the sound muted for the default loading. The bottom video is shamelessly ripped from the DCS youtube site for my own educational purposes of creating this site. However, I'll remove it if asked. I resized the video (smaller), added an .vtt caption attribute, and rehosted it here on github.</p>

		<p>In todays idiot's blog chronicling the learning steps of how to create a DCS server and associated website, I'm continuing working through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" target="_blank" title="Mozilla Web Docs">Mozilla MDN Docs Guides and Tutorials</a>, and currently starting the "HTML — Structuring the Web, Introduction to HTML, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting" target="_blank" title="Go to Advanced Text Formatting">Advanced text formatting</a>" chapter. This Rising Thunder Alfa Test website is becoming a little more "developed?", with a small number of useless and dysfunctional features, but features, none the less.</p>
		<p>Thanks to a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZyEv_VrwGLq-UcgANDb0IQ" target="_blank" title="Go to DCS Flighttraining's Youtube Channel">DCS Flighttraining</a> on YouTube, "<a href="https://youtu.be/c19Gi0SjEE0" target="_blank" title="Open the YouTube video">Basics of exporting data out of DCS World via Export.lua</a>", I've learned how to export the current mission time from DCS to a txt file. When the "<code>LoGetModelTime()</code>" function is inserted into the <var>Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/Export.lua</var> file, it will generate a "living" data.txt file, the last line being the current DCS mission time. Of course, I still do not know how to export this data from the text file into a HTML file.</p>

	    <p>For my next step of this idiots guide quest, I've completed the Mozilla "Getting started with the Web" course, an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	       In the process of working through this introductory course, I created my own simple exercise webpage as suggested by the author, instead of just cutting and pasting the giving examples of code, and I did some experimental customization, geared towards a DCS Server theme, of course. My next step in this quest is to work through the Mozilla "Learning HTML: Guides and tutorials" course.</p>

	    <p>First, I'm very new, and an "idiot" at setting up servers and webpages.
          However, I do have a dedicated DCS server successfully running on my local machine, using the default DCS server ports.
		  Additionaly I have successfully installed <a href="https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=155563" target="_blank" title="Go to Slmod Thread">Slmod</a>, and it seams to work, using basic -help commands, and etc.</p>

        <p>For a beginners practice and learning exercise, and for the motivation of success, or the agony of defeat, I would like learn how to simply export just the following data;</p>

		<dl>
		  <dt>Servers Current:</dt>
		    <dd>mission start time,</dd>
		    <dd>actual and "running"- "DCS server mission map time",</dd>
		    <dd>"mission end time" as set by the "<samp>TIME MORE</samp>" conditions, for the "<samp>END MISSION</samp>" or "<samp>LOAD MISSION</samp>" action triggers,</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>Into a local webpage/html file, in a standard 24 hour digital output/readout, and having the current missions time displayed as a running digita output and horizontal bar-graph.</p>

		<p>For example;<br>
		   Mission Start --- Current Map Time --- End Time<br>
           0600 ------------ 0900 --------------- 1400<br>
		   <span class="bluetext" id="blueBackground">[_______________|</span>_________________]</p>

		<p>Can this be done using just a local html file, and opened with a browser (Firefox), or must I install something like a Python's "SimpleHTTPServer" module? <span class="greytext">[EDIT] Yes, Python SimpleHTTPSever or simular will be needed.</span>
		   Will I need any other "app"? How do I export the data, and "link" it to the webpage (or app, if needed).<span class="greytext"> [EDIT] To export time data <em>from the DCS server</em> see our Code Repository. I still do not know how it import the time data into a html file.</span></p>

		<p>If anyone would like to take the time to write a idiot guide, or post in how to accomplish this basic feat, it would be greatly appreciated.<br>
		   I'm thinking this exercise will be a great help in explaining and showing the basics of setting up a DCS Server, with an associated webpage. Also I'm assuming the basic concepts of this exercise will apply to most other planned functions going forward.</p>
