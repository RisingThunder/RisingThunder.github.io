	  <p>The CSS &quot;ID&quot; selector matches an element based on the value of its id attribute.
	  In order for the element to be selected, its id attribute must match exactly the value
	  given in the selector. For example, this &lt;div&gt; has a special ID on it!</p>

	  <p>The CSS &quot;class&quot; selector matches an element based on the value of its class attribute.
	  In order for the element to be selected, its class attribute must match exactly the value given in the

	<div class="boxChild">
	  <p>The &quot;:first-child&quot; CSS pseudo-class represents the first element among a group of sibling elements.

		 first element among its siblings(&lt;p&gt; elements)(grey background /w black text applied). </p>
	  <p>However, this paragraph was not selected as it is the second element in this division (no background /w default blue text).</p>
